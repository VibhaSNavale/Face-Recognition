A Python project made using the OpenCV library. 
It includes the feature of being able to log in either using face recognition or by entering their login details.
The accuracy of this system is high as it takes at least 50 samples of the user's face when they first sign up.
After a successful login, the user can access previous years' question papers (ISE) from 3rd sem to 8th sem.
